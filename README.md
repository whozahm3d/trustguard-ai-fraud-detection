## Description

Financial fraud is a growing threat in the digital banking era, costing institutions and individuals trillions of dollars each year. TrustGuard AI is an end-to-end AI-powered fraud detection system that uses machine learning to identify suspicious financial transactions and integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** to provide transparent, interpretable reasoning behind every prediction. A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) policy assistant** will further enhance the system by retrieving relevant banking regulations and fraud policies to explain why certain transactions are flagged — making TrustGuard AI both accurate and accountable.

This repository contains **Deliverable 1**, covering the complete data acquisition, preprocessing pipeline, and exploratory data analysis on the PaySim synthetic financial dataset.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions process millions of digital transactions daily. Identifying fraudulent activity is challenging because fraud patterns evolve continuously and often closely resemble legitimate behavior. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to detect new and sophisticated fraud strategies, frequently producing high false-positive rates that overwhelm fraud analysts.

TrustGuard AI addresses this by developing a machine learning-based framework that learns hidden behavioral patterns in transaction data, detects anomalies with higher accuracy, and provides transparent, explainable decisions — meeting both operational and regulatory requirements.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing:** Load, inspect, clean, and prepare the PaySim dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize transaction patterns and uncover key fraud signals.
- **Feature Engineering:** Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features for model readiness.
- **Fraud Detection Model:** Train and evaluate machine learning classifiers to identify fraudulent transactions.
- **Explainability:** Apply SHAP and LIME to make model predictions interpretable and transparent.
- **RAG Policy Assistant:** Retrieve relevant fraud regulations and generate policy-grounded explanations.
- **Web Interface:** Deploy a real-time fraud monitoring dashboard for analysts and institutions.

## Dataset

This project uses the **PaySim Synthetic Financial Dataset for Fraud Detection**, available on Kaggle.

> Dataset Link: [Kaggle — Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)

PaySim simulates real-world mobile money transactions calibrated against private data from an African mobile payment service. It provides a realistic and privacy-preserving environment for training fraud detection models.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Transactions | 6,362,620 |
| Total Features | 11 |
| Fraudulent Transactions | 8,213 (0.13%) |
| Fraud Transaction Types | TRANSFER, CASH_OUT only |
| Missing Values | None |
| Duplicate Records | None |

**Key Features:**

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `step` | Simulated time unit (1 step = 1 hour) |
| `type` | Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER) |
| `amount` | Transaction amount in local currency |
| `oldbalanceOrg` | Originating account balance before transaction |
| `newbalanceOrig` | Originating account balance after transaction |
| `oldbalanceDest` | Destination account balance before transaction |
| `newbalanceDest` | Destination account balance after transaction |
| `isFraud` | Target label: 1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate |

> **Note:** The raw dataset is not included in this repository due to size. Download it from the link above and place it in `data/raw/`.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trustguard-ai-fraud-detection.git
cd trustguard-ai-fraud-detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Download the PaySim dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1) and place the CSV file in the `data/raw/` directory:

```
data/raw/PaySim - Synthetic Financial Dataset for Fraud Detection.csv
```

---

## Usage

### Run the Full Preprocessing Pipeline

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

This will execute all pipeline stages in sequence:
1. Load the dataset
2. Inspect shape, types, and statistics
3. Remove duplicates and handle outliers
4. Encode the `type` column using LabelEncoder
5. Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
6. Export the processed dataset to `data/processed/processed_paysim.csv`

### Run EDA Only

```bash
python scripts/eda_analysis.py
```

### Use the Notebooks

Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/deliverable1_pipeline.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
```

## Results — Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA uncovered the following key fraud patterns in the PaySim dataset:

### Transaction Volume Over Time
![Transaction Volume Over Time](images/transaction_volume_over_time.png)
> A strong diurnal cycle is visible — transaction volumes peak every ~24 steps. Sudden spikes outside this rhythm may signal abnormal batch activity.

### Fraud vs. Legitimate Class Distribution
![Fraud Distribution](images/fraud_distribution/fraud_distribution.png)
> Only **0.13%** of transactions are fraudulent (8,213 of 6.36M). This severe imbalance means standard accuracy is a misleading metric — AUPRC and F1-score must be used.

### Transaction Type Distribution
![Transaction Types](images/transaction_types/transaction_types.png)
> PAYMENT and CASH_OUT are the most frequent types. However, volume alone does not reflect fraud risk.

### Fraud Concentration by Transaction Type
![Fraud by Transaction Type](images/fraud_by_transaction_type/fraud_by_transaction_type.png)
> **Fraud occurs exclusively in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions.** This allows a pre-filter that eliminates ~55% of records from fraud modelling with zero loss in recall.

### Transaction Amount Distribution
![Transaction Amount Distribution](images/transaction_amount_distribution/transaction_amount_distribution.png)
> Heavily right-skewed — most transactions are below 500K but a tail extends to ~92M. Feature scaling is essential.

### Transaction Amount: Fraud vs. Legitimate
![Fraud vs Normal Amounts](images/transaction_types/fraud_vs_normal_transaction_amounts.png)
> Fraudulent transactions cluster at higher amounts with a broader spread, confirming large amounts as a key fraud signal.

### Feature Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatmap/correlation_heatmap.png)
> Balance features are strongly inter-correlated. `isFlaggedFraud` shows near-zero correlation with actual fraud — it must be excluded from model features.

### Feature Importance (Correlation with Fraud Label)
![Feature Importance](images/transaction_types/feature_importance.png)
> `oldbalanceOrg` and `newbalanceOrig` are the strongest predictors — fraudulent transactions characteristically drain the originating account to zero (the **balance-drain signature**).

## Future Work

- **Deliverable 2 — Model Development:** Train and benchmark Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM classifiers with SMOTE-based oversampling to handle class imbalance.
- **Deliverable 3 — Explainable AI:** Integrate SHAP and LIME to generate per-prediction feature attribution explanations for fraud analysts.
- **Deliverable 3 — RAG Policy Assistant:** Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that retrieves compliance policies and AML regulations to provide context-aware, natural-language explanations for flagged transactions.
- **Final Deliverable — Deployment:** Deploy the full system as a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit or React frontend for real-time fraud monitoring.
